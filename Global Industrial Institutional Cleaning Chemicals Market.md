<h3>Market Drivers</h3>
<h4>Prevalence of Disease Outbreaks</h4>
<p>The rise in healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) has significantly boosted the demand for industrial and institutional cleaning chemicals. HAIs, such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) and surgical site infections (SSI), are a major concern in healthcare facilities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), these infections are often caused by inadequate infection control practices and prolonged exposure to contaminated environments. The need for effective cleaning and disinfection solutions in hospitals and other healthcare settings is driving market growth.</p>
<h4>Emergence of Plant Oil-Based Chemicals</h4>
<p>The shift toward sustainable and eco-friendly cleaning solutions is another key driver. Plant oil-based chemicals, derived from sources like palm kernel and coconut oil, are gaining traction as alternatives to petrochemical-based products. Governments worldwide are promoting the use of bio-based chemicals to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, further propelling market growth. The American Chemical Society highlights the importance of renewable feedstock in addressing global environmental challenges, which has led to increased consumer awareness and demand for sustainable cleaning products.</p>
