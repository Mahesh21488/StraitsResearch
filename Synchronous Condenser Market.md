<p><strong>Air-Cooled</strong>: These condensers use ambient air to dissipate heat and are ideal for regions with limited water availability. They are simple to construct and require minimal maintenance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Water-Cooled</strong>: These use water as a cooling medium and are suitable for applications requiring efficient heat dissipation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hydrogen-Cooled</strong>: Dominating the market, hydrogen-cooled condensers offer high thermal conductivity and efficient heat transfer, making them ideal for large-scale power plants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>By Starting Method</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Static Frequency Converter (SFC)</strong>: This method uses electronic converters to regulate frequency and voltage during startup, ensuring smooth synchronization with the grid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pony Motors</strong>: These auxiliary motors rotate the rotor to near-synchronous speed before connecting to the grid, providing the initial mechanical energy required.</p>
