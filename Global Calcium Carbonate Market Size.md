<p>The global calcium carbonate market has witnessed significant growth in recent years, driven by its widespread applications across various industries. In 2024, the market was valued at USD 52.24 billion and is projected to grow from USD 55.48 billion in 2025 to USD 89.77 billion by 2033, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.20% during the forecast period (2025-2033). This growth is fueled by the increasing demand for calcium carbonate in industries such as paper, plastics, paints, and construction, among others.</p>
<p>Calcium carbonate, chemically represented as CaCO3, is a naturally occurring mineral found in rocks like limestone, calcite, and aragonite. It is a key component in the formation of pearls, gastropod shells, and eggshells. The mineral is also widely used in agriculture as agricultural lime, which helps neutralize acidic soils and improve crop yields. The rising demand for paper products, particularly in packaging and hygiene-related applications like tissue paper, is one of the primary drivers of the calcium carbonate market.</p>
