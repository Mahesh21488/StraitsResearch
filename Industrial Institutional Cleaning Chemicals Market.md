<p><strong>Market Drivers</strong></p>
<p>Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), including catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and surgical site infections (SSI), have increased the demand for effective cleaning chemicals. Regulatory bodies emphasize stringent hygiene practices to reduce infection transmission in healthcare facilities. The rising demand for sustainable alternatives to petrochemical-based products has driven the adoption of plant-based chemicals. These include oleochemicals derived from palm kernel, palm stearin, and coconut oil, aligning with global sustainability initiatives.</p>
<p>While some startups have entered the market due to favorable government policies and incentives, the high costs of raw materials, registration, and capital investments pose significant entry barriers. Established companies dominate the market with strong supply chains and aggressive competitive strategies. The availability of multiple suppliers ensures a steady raw material supply. However, increased demand for feedstock in various industrial applications leads to higher raw material costs. Major players like Godrej and BASF are expanding their operations through vertical integration to manage costs and supply chain efficiency.</p>
