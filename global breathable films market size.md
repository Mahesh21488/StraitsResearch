<p><strong>Market Size and Forecast</strong></p>
<p>The global&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://straitsresearch.com/report/breathable-films-market">breathable films market</a> </strong>was valued at USD 19.80 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.54%, reaching USD 38.09 billion by 2030. This robust growth is driven by increasing demand across industries such as hygiene, healthcare, packaging, and building and construction.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Breathable films are thermoplastic polymer-based films that offer a unique combination of moisture control, breathability, and water vapor permeability. These films, produced primarily through extrusion technology, are gaining significant traction in a wide range of applications, including disposable hygiene products (such as diapers, sanitary napkins, and adult incontinence pads), protective clothing, mattresses, and packaging. Their eco-friendly and moisture-locking properties make them highly sought after for use in personal care, medical, and industrial sectors.</p>
