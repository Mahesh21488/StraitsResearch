<p data-start="0" data-end="1241" data-is-last-node="">The hard kombucha market is driven by changing consumer behavior, with a growing preference for fermented beverages that offer health benefits such as improved digestion, reduced inflammation, and antioxidant properties. Brands like JuneShine and Flying Embers have capitalized on this trend by introducing low-calorie, low-sugar, and probiotic-rich hard kombucha options. Additionally, the reduction in alcohol consumption, particularly in the U.S. and the U.K., has fueled demand for low-alcohol alternatives, with hard kombucha (ranging from 1-10% ABV) emerging as a popular choice due to its lower calorie content compared to beer. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated this shift as health-conscious consumers increasingly opted for low-alcohol beverages.</p>
