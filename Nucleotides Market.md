<p>Nucleotides, low-molecular-weight intracellular substances, play a vital role in various biochemical processes. They are essential for the synthesis of nucleic acids and are particularly crucial for the rapid proliferation of lymphoid and epithelial cells in the mucosa. While nucleotides can be synthesized within cells from precursors like glutamine, aspartic acid, and glycine, dietary sources such as bovine milk also contribute significantly. Nucleotides are known to enhance immune function, improve digestion, and aid in the absorption of micronutrients. Their inclusion in infant formula has gained traction due to their presence in human milk, further driving market demand.</p>
