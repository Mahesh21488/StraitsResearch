<p>The global <strong><a href="https://straitsresearch.com/report/hydraulic-turbine-market">Hydraulic Turbine Market</a></strong> was valued at USD 17,850.3 million in 2021 and is projected to reach USD 32,269.1 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.80% during the forecast period (2022-2030). This growth is driven by the global transition toward renewable energy, technological advancements, and government support for clean energy solutions. Hydraulic turbines are vital for converting the kinetic energy of falling or flowing water into mechanical energy, which is then converted into electricity via a hydroelectric generator. These turbines are crucial in the production of clean, renewable energy, and their application spans industrial, commercial, and residential sectors.</p>
<h3>Market Dynamics</h3>
<p><strong>Drivers:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Rising Demand for Renewable Energy:</strong> As governments worldwide push for sustainable and renewable energy sources to reduce carbon emissions, the demand for hydraulic turbines has surged. Hydraulic turbines offer a far more efficient energy generation method compared to fossil fuels, achieving efficiency rates of up to 90%, significantly higher than the 35-45% efficiency of fossil fuel plants. Additionally, hydraulic turbines do not emit greenhouse gases or consume natural resources, making them an environmentally friendly option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Government Initiatives and Financial Incentives:</strong> Many governments are offering financial incentives, subsidies, and tax credits for renewable energy projects, which includes support for hydropower installations. For example, the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the renewable electricity production tax credit program encourage the creation of hydroelectricity through financial incentives, driving market growth.</p>

<h3>Market Segmentation</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>By Type:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impulse Turbines:</strong> The impulse turbine segment holds the largest market share and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.30%. These turbines are ideal for high water heads and are commonly used in small and medium-sized hydropower plants. Pelton wheels and cross-flow turbines are popular designs under this category.</li>
<li><strong>Reaction Turbines:</strong> These turbines are mainly used in hydroelectric power plants where they produce the most power at low water heads. Reaction turbines are known for their high overall energy generation capabilities but have lower energy transfer efficiency compared to impulse turbines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By Rating:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10 MW and Above:</strong> The largest segment by market share, used in large-scale hydropower projects catering to industrial and commercial sectors. These turbines are typically employed in large dams and run-of-the-river systems, serving urban areas and heavy industries.</li>
<li><strong>1 MW to 10 MW:</strong> Suitable for medium-scale industrial and commercial applications, this segment is also expected to see significant growth as demand for sustainable energy solutions rises.</li>
<li><strong>Less Than 1 MW:</strong> These turbines are used for residential applications or small-scale power generation, such as mini-hydro or micro-hydro systems in rural areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Regional Insights</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Asia-Pacific:</strong> The Asia-Pacific region holds the largest share of the global hydraulic turbine market, accounting for over 50% of the total revenue. China is the largest hydropower producer globally, generating 4-5 times more hydropower than the United States in 2020. The rapid development of hydropower projects like the Wudong-de and Baihetan Hydropower projects will further accelerate the market's growth in this region, with a forecasted CAGR of 7.60%.</p>
</li>
<li>
