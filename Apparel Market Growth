Data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the International Trade Centre (ITC) indicate that while online retail is growing, physical stores still account for a significant portion of apparel sales. Many consumers, particularly in regions like Europe and Asia-Pacific, prefer to shop in person, as they can physically inspect and try on clothing before making a purchase. According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), large retailers such as Uniqlo, H&amp;M, and department stores remain highly competitive in the offline market due to their established customer bases and wide product assortments.</p>
