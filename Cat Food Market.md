<p><strong>Market Growth Factors</strong></p>
<p>Cats are the second most popular pet globally, with their population growing by 19.2% from 2017 to 2022. In Russia, where cats are considered symbols of fortune, pet ownership rates are particularly high. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated cat adoption, as people sought companionship while staying indoors. Millennials, who make up a significant portion of pet owners (33% in the U.S. in 2022), have played a key role in this trend.</p>
<p>Pet owners are becoming more conscious of their pets&rsquo; well-being, driving demand for organic cat food free from artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives. This shift has prompted manufacturers to introduce health-focused cat food products. For example, in 2023, Hill&rsquo;s Pet Nutrition launched specialized wet and dry food formulas for cats with cancer.</p>
<p>Market Challenges</p>
<p>Despite the growing market, many pet owners still prefer home-prepared meals due to high costs and limited availability of commercial cat food options. Some owners believe that home-cooked diets offer better customization and health benefits for their cats, which can restrain market growth.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The global cat food market is on a strong growth trajectory, supported by rising pet adoption, growing awareness of pet nutrition, and evolving consumer preferences. With ongoing product innovation and expansion by key industry players, the market is expected to achieve significant growth through 2033.</p>
