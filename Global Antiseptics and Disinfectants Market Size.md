<h3>Growth Drivers</h3>
<p>The primary factor propelling the growth of the antiseptics and disinfectants market is the increasing prevalence of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). Patients undergoing long-term treatments, particularly surgical procedures, are more susceptible to HAIs due to improper hygiene, excessive antibiotic use, and the presence of invasive devices. The application of antiseptics and disinfectants significantly reduces the risk of such infections. According to the CDC, approximately 1.7 million HAIs occur in American hospitals each year, leading to nearly 99,000 deaths. Consequently, the growing demand for effective infection control measures is expected to drive market expansion.</p>
<p>Rising awareness regarding household hygiene is another major driver of market growth. The prevalence of diseases such as cholera, typhoid, food poisoning, hepatitis A, and dengue has highlighted the need for maintaining clean home environments. Reports from the ECDC indicate an increasing number of cases of dengue fever in Europe, emphasizing the necessity of effective disinfection. Households are increasingly using antiseptic and disinfectant solutions to prevent bacterial and viral growth, reducing the incidence of infections and promoting overall public health.</p>
