<p>The research methodology for this report includes a comprehensive analysis of market trends, historical data, and future projections. It incorporates insights from industry experts, government policies, and technological advancements in nuclear decommissioning. The study also examines the impact of geopolitical decisions, public safety concerns, and the economic viability of nuclear power plants on the market's growth trajectory.</p>
<h3>Market Segmentation</h3>
<h4>By Reactor Type</h4>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<p>Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR):&nbsp;Dominating the market in 2021, PWRs are favored for their stability and operational efficiency. Their widespread use and installation are expected to drive significant growth in this segment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boiling Water Reactor (BWR):&nbsp;Another key segment, BWRs are widely used in nuclear power generation, contributing to the demand for decommissioning services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR):&nbsp;Known for their use of heavy water as a coolant, PHWRs are also a significant part of the market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gas Cooled Reactor (GCR):&nbsp;These reactors, which use gas as a coolant, represent a smaller but growing segment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Others:&nbsp;This category includes experimental and prototype reactors that require decommissioning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>By Strategy</h4>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<p>Immediate Dismantling:&nbsp;The most common approach, involving the prompt dismantling of reactors after shutdown. This method is preferred for its efficiency and reduced long-term costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deferred Dismantling:&nbsp;This strategy involves placing reactors in safe storage for several years before dismantling, allowing radiation levels to decrease naturally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entombment:&nbsp;A cost-effective but less commonly adopted method, entombment involves encasing the reactor in concrete and burying it underground. While quicker, it raises environmental and public safety concerns.</p>
</li>
