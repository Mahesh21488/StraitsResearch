<p><strong>Market Dynamics</strong></p>
<p>Heightening concerns about food wastage are a major growth driver. The FAO estimates that one-third of food produced globally is wasted each year, leading to significant environmental and economic losses. This has propelled businesses to adopt food cold chain solutions, including refrigerated storage and transport methods. Risks associated with suppliers, system failures, and security breaches pose significant challenges. Inadequate packaging, improper handling, and failure to adhere to recommended temperature-controlled environments lead to substantial product losses.</p>
<p>The rising demand for convenient and frozen bakery options in urban markets, particularly in North America and Europe, has created opportunities for cold chain expansion. Consumers increasingly prefer frozen bakery products due to their longer shelf life and consistent quality, further fueling market growth.</p>
