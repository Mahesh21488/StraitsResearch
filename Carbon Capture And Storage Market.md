<h3><strong>Segmentation Analysis</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>By Technology</strong></h4>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<p><strong>Pre-combustion Capture</strong>: This segment is expected to dominate the market during the forecast period. Pre-combustion capture involves converting fuel into a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide before combustion. The process is particularly effective in gasification and reforming processes, where synthesis gas (syngas) is produced. Research and development efforts are focused on enhancing solvents, solid sorbents, and membrane systems to improve efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post-combustion Capture</strong>: This segment is anticipated to hold the second-largest market share. Post-combustion capture involves separating CO2 from flue gases after combustion. Liquid solvents are commonly used to absorb CO2, which is then compressed for storage and transportation. This method is widely applicable in existing power plants and industrial facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oxy-fuel Combustion Capture</strong>: This technology involves burning fuel in an oxygen-rich environment, resulting in a flue gas primarily composed of CO2 and water vapor. The CO2 is then captured and stored. Although less prevalent than pre- and post-combustion methods, oxy-fuel combustion is gaining traction due to its potential for high CO2 capture rates.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>By End-User Industry</strong></h4>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<p><strong>Oil and Gas</strong>: This sector is expected to account for the largest revenue share, driven by the use of CCS for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). CO2 injection into oil fields not only boosts oil production but also facilitates the permanent storage of CO2, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coal and Biomass Power Plants</strong>: The second-largest segment, coal and biomass power plants, are significant sources of CO2 emissions. CCS technologies, particularly post-combustion capture, are increasingly being adopted to reduce emissions from these facilities. The integration of biomass with CCS (BECCS) offers additional benefits by capturing CO2 during the biomass growth cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Iron and Steel</strong>: The iron and steel industry is a major contributor to global CO2 emissions. CCS technologies are being explored to capture emissions from blast furnaces and other processes, helping the industry transition to low-carbon production methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chemical</strong>: The chemical industry is also adopting CCS to reduce emissions from various production processes. The capture and storage of CO2 from chemical plants contribute to the overall reduction of greenhouse gases.</p>
