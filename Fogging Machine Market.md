<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The global <strong><a href="https://straitsresearch.com/report/fogging-machine-market">Fogging Machine Market</a>,</strong> valued at USD 7.36 billion in 2022, is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.76% to reach USD 15.67 billion by 2031. The increasing demand for disinfection solutions across various industries and advancements in fogging technologies are driving this growth.</p>
<p><strong>Market Overview</strong></p>
<p>Fogging machines, also known as fog generators or smoke machines, are devices that release dense vapor for effective disinfection and sanitation. These machines are widely used in professional entertainment, agriculture, healthcare, hospitality, and contract cleaning services. By vaporizing or atomizing liquids such as mineral oils, water, and glycol- or glycerin-based solutions, fogging machines ensure thorough coverage of hard-to-reach areas and confined spaces. The demand for such devices has surged due to their ability to address hygiene and pest control requirements efficiently.</p>
