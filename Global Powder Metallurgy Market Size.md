<h3>Market Drivers</h3>
<p>The aerospace and defense industry is a significant driver of the powder metallurgy market. The sector's focus on reducing aircraft weight and enhancing efficiency has led to increased adoption of PM techniques. Additive manufacturing, a subset of PM, is gaining traction due to its ability to produce complex, lightweight components with minimal material waste. This technology is particularly beneficial for low-volume production, where traditional methods like forging and casting are less cost-effective.</p>
<p>The rising defense budgets and increasing passenger traffic in countries like India and China further bolster this growth. For instance, India's domestic passenger traffic grew by&nbsp;3.74% in 2019, and the country is expected to become the&nbsp;third-largest aviation market by 2036, with over&nbsp;478 million passengers. Similarly, China is projected to demand&nbsp;7,500 commercial aircraft valued at USD 1.2 trillion by 2040, driving the need for advanced PM components.</p>
<p>Powder metallurgy is widely used in industries such as&nbsp;automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and electronics. The technique offers numerous advantages, including reduced material waste, cost efficiency, and the ability to produce complex geometries. In the automotive sector, PM is used to manufacture components like sensor bosses, flanges, and exhaust gas fittings, driven by stringent environmental regulations and the demand for durable parts.</p>
<p>The electronics industry is also witnessing increased adoption of PM, particularly in the production of batteries and electronic devices. The aerospace sector's demand for high-performance materials with controlled porosity and high heat capacity further fuels market growth.</p>
