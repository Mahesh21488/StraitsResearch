<p>The global <strong><a href="https://straitsresearch.com/report/maleic-anhydride-market">Maleic Anhydride Market</a></strong> has witnessed steady growth, with its valuation reaching&nbsp;USD 2.45 billion in 2023. Projections indicate that the market will expand to&nbsp;USD 3.50 billion by 2032, growing at a&nbsp;compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.05%&nbsp;during the forecast period (2024&ndash;2032). This growth is primarily driven by increasing demand from end-user industries, particularly the automotive sector, where maleic anhydride is a critical raw material for producing unsaturated polyester resins (UPR). These resins are essential for manufacturing lightweight and high-performance automotive components. Additionally, strategic initiatives by key market players are creating opportunities for further market expansion.</p>
<p>Maleic anhydride, an organic compound with the formula&nbsp;C4H2O3, is the acid anhydride of maleic acid. It is a colorless or white solid with a pungent odor and is widely used in industries for producing coatings, polymers, resins, and chemical derivatives. The compound is synthesized through the vapor-phase oxidation of n-butane, a process that has largely replaced older methods using benzene due to its cost efficiency and environmental benefits. Maleic anhydride's versatility in chemical reactions, such as the Diels-Alder reaction, has made it a valuable component in the production of pesticides, pharmaceuticals, polyimides, and liquid crystal display alignment films.</p>
